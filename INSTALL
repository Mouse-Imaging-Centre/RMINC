INSTALLATION
=============

Every effort has been made to make RMINC as easy to install as possible. 
For most systems install.packages("RMINC") should be all you need
to begin experimenting with MINC files in R. For a richer experience
The highly recommended approach is to acquire the minc-toolkit (v2),
this package will allow you to use command line tools in addition
to RMINC to manipulate minc files.

The binaries for the toolkit can be acquired from http://bic-mni.github.io/ 
in the section V2. Alternatively, the toolkit can be build from source
with code from https://github.com/BIC-MNI/minc-toolkit-v2.

If the toolkit is found on your system, the installation will be a bit faster.

If the toolkit is not found on your system RMINC will attempt to install
libminc (https://github.com/BIC-MNI/libminc) for you. This provides the
core functionality needed to use RMINC. In order to install libminc
you need a few dependencies. You need a version of cmake greater the 2.6,
you will need git installed to fetch the code, and you will need the 
development headers for HDF5 the file format underlying MINC. 
The HDF5 header can be acquired on Debian/Ubuntu type linux systems
with `sudo apt-get install libhdf5-dev`, or with on Mac OSX with
the brew package manager `brew install homebrew/science/hdf5`. 

If you find yourself in a position where you need to install these
dependencies it is probably best to just install the toolkit as
discussed above. The toolkit provides HDF5 for you.
