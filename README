Statistics for MINC volumes: A library to integrate voxel-based
statistics for MINC volumes into the R environment.  Supports getting
and writing of MINC volumes, running voxel-wise linear models,
correlations, etc.; correcting for multiple comparisons using the
False Discovery Rate, and more. With contributions from Jason Lerch,
Chris Hammill, Jim Nikelski, Matthijs van Eede and Daniel Cassel. Some

Installation:
-------------

RMINC provides functionality for working with Medical Imaging NetCDF
files, and relies on C libraries specifically designed for working
with these files. For the richest experience please install the
minc-toolkit (v2), either from the binary installer:
http://bic-mni.github.io/ or from source:
https://github.com/BIC-MNI/minc-toolkit-v2. If the toolkit is not
found on your system, RMINC will attempt to install libminc from
source. This requires a version of CMake greater than 2.6 and git, as
well as the HDF5 development headers. For more details read the
INSTALL file

**Currently there is no support for RMINC on windows**
