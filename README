A library for statistical analysis of neuroimaging data,
focused on the MINC file format. Supports getting
and writing volumes, running voxel-wise linear models,
correlations, correcting for multiple comparisons with False Discovery Rate
control, and more. With contributions from Jason Lerch,
Chris Hammill, Jim Nikelski, Matthijs van Eede and Daniel Cassel

Installation:
-------------

RMINC provides functionality for working with Medical Imaging NetCDF
files, and relies on C libraries specifically designed for working
with these files. For the richest experience please install the
minc-toolkit (v2), either from the binary installer:
http://bic-mni.github.io/ or from source:
https://github.com/BIC-MNI/minc-toolkit-v2. If the toolkit is not
found on your system, RMINC will attempt to install libminc from
source. This requires a version of CMake greater than 2.6 and git, as
well as the HDF5 development headers. For more details read the
INSTALL file

**Currently there is no support for RMINC on windows**
