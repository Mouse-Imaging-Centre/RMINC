        * Added basic NAMESPACE file to the package
        * moved the "sums" method in anatGetFile to "slow_sums". This function
          uses a phyton script that runs extremely slowly when the number of 
          defined labels gets large (for instance the  Allen Brain annotations)
        * added a new "sums" method in anatGetFile that uses a minc tool written
          in c code (compute_counts_for_labels). This function is part of the 
          GitHub repository: minc-stuffs

	* bumped version to 1.1.1
	* minor bug fixes to pMincApply and mincLm
	
2013-01-14 Jason Lerch <jason@phenogenomics.ca>
	* bumped version to 1.1
	* mask in modelling functions by default now evaluated at above 0.5
	* pMincApply: new function that executes mincApply in parallel
	* added mincApply and pMincApply documentation.
	
2012-11-15 Matthijs van Eede <matthijs@phenogenomics.ca>
	* The most popular/default behaviour of anatGetAll (getting volume information about the structures in Adrienne Dorr's mouse brain atlas using the c57_brain_atlas_labels.csv) has changed because of the previous commit (dropping label 0 by default). To regain default behaviour, the flag dropLabels for anatGetAll is now set to TRUE by default.

2012-11-14 Matthijs van Eede <matthijs@phenogenomics.ca>
	* The function AnatGetAll gets information about labels/segmentations for a list of input files. By default the label 0 (background) was added to the list of labels that would be returned by the function. This caused some issues when the parameter dropLabels was set to True. So now label 0 is not added to the list of labels by default anymore. If you care about the background, you will need to add 0 (for left and right) to your definitions.

2012-11-03 Jason Lerch <jason@phenogenomics.ca>
	* bumped version to 1.0.5
	* added anatGetAll man page
	* added method=sums to anatGetAll, anatGetFile, and anatCombineStructures
2012-10-02 Matthijs van Eede <matthijs@phenogenomics.ca>

	* added a couple of checks in the anatGetAll function to compare the list of labels that was found in an input file and the labels that are defined in the mapping. If there are any discrepancies, that can lead to hard to debug problems...
