\title{Call ray_trace to get an image of a rendered slice}
\usage{
minc.ray.trace(
  volume,
  output = "slice.rgb",
  size = c(400, 400),
  slice = list(pos = 0, wv = "w", axis = "z"),
  threshold = NULL,
  colourmap = "-spectral",
  background = NULL,
  background.threshold = NULL,
  background.colourmap = "-gray",
  display = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{volume}{The filename of a volume to render.}

\item{output}{The output filename.}

\item{size}{A vector of two elements specifying the output size}

\item{slice}{A list of three elements, pos being the slice number, wv
whether the specification is in voxel or world space, and the axis.}

\item{threshold}{A vector of two elements containing the threshold. If NULL,
the full range of the volume will be used.}

\item{colourmap}{The colourmap to be used by ray_trace.}

\item{background}{An optional filename of a background volume. Used, for
example, to render statistical results on top of background anatomy.}

\item{background.threshold}{Threshold to use for the background volume. If
NULL the whole range will be used.}

\item{background.colourmap}{The colourmap argument to be passed to ray_trace
for the background image.}

\item{display}{Boolean argument which determines whether display (from
ImageMagick) will be called on the output.}
}
\value{
\item{output}{The filename of the output image is returned.}
}
\description{
This function provides an interface to the ray_trace command written by
David MacDonald. As such it needs both ray_trace and make_slice to be on the
path upon startup of R, and the bicpl library has to be compiled with image
output enabled.
}
\details{
Behaviour of minc.ray.trace varies depending on whether a background image
is specified. If background=NULL, then the specified slice is rendered using
the supplied (or automatically determined) threshold argument. If there is a
background image, then the slice from the input volume is rendered
semi-transparently on top of the background.

Note that cropping in ray_trace is on by default, so the output image size
will not necessarily be the same as the size argument to minc.ray.trace.
