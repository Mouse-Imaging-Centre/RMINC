\title{Compute the False Discovery Rate on the output of a mincLm type run}
\usage{
\method{mincFDR}{mincSingleDim}(buffer, df, mask=NULL, method="qvalue", \dots)
\method{mincFDR}{mincMultiDim}(buffer, columns=NULL, mask=NULL, df=NULL,method="FDR", statType=NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{buffer}{The results of a mincLm type run.}

\item{columns}{A vector of column names. By default the threshold will
be computed for all columns; with this argument the computation can
be limited to a subset.}

\item{mask}{Either a filename or a numeric vector representing a mask
only values inside the mask will be used to compute the
threshold.}

\item{df}{The degrees of freedom - normally this can be determined
from the input object.}

\item{statType}{This should be either a "t","F","u","chisq" or "tlmer" depending upon the
type of statistic being thresholded.}

\item{method}{The method used to compute the false discovery
rate. Options are "FDR" and "pFDR".}
}
\value{
qvals mincFDR returns an object with the same number of columns
 as the input (or the subset specified by the columns argument to
 mincFDR). Each column now contains the qvalues for each voxel. Areas
 outside the mask (if a mask was specified) will be represented by a
 value of 1. The result also has an attribute called "thresholds"
 which contains the 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20 percent false discovery rate
 thresholds.

\description{
Takes the output of a mincLm type run and computes the False Discovery Rate on the results.
}
\details{
This function uses the \code{qvalue} package to compute the
 False Discovery Rate threshold for the results of a \link{mincLm}
 computation. The False Discovery Rate represents the percentage of
 results expected to be a false positive. Two implementations can be
 used as specified by the method argument. "FDR" uses the
 implementation in \code{p.adjust}, whereas "pFDR" is a version of the
 postivie False Discovery Rate as found in John Storey's \code{qvalue}
 package.
