\title{Compare a set of massively-univariate models}
\usage{
compare_models(object, ..., metric = AICc)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A model or a list of models, typically 
\link{mincLm}, \link{vertexLm}, or \link{anatLm} results.}

\item{...}{additional models}

\item{metric}{A function to apply to the models that extracts a result
for each independent sub-model. Typical choices are \link{AIC}, \link{AICc}, 
and \link{BIC}. Please note that metrics are considered such that lower is 
better (in following AIC). To use a positive metric create a wrapper function
that performs the negation, for example, to use the un-modified log-likelihood 
you could pass \code{ metric = function(minc_model){ -minc_model[,"logLik"]} }}
}
\value{
A sub-model x n models \code{model_comparison} matrix with the metric of interest.
}
\description{
For each response (voxel, vertex, or structure) compare
a set of linear model formulations with the criterion of your
choice (e.g. AIC, AICc, BIC).
