Compute a sequential ANOVA at each voxel}
\usage{
mincAnova(
  formula,
  data = NULL,
  subset = NULL,
  mask = NULL,
  maskval = NULL,
  parallel = NULL,
  cleanup = TRUE,
  conf_file = getOption("RMINC_BATCH_CONF")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{The anova formula. The left-hand term consists of the 
MINC filenames over which to compute the models at every voxel.}

\item{data}{The dataframe which contains the model terms.}

\item{subset}{Subset definition.}

\item{mask}{Either a filename or a vector of values of the same 
length as the input files. ANOVA will only be computed
inside the mask.}

\item{maskval}{the value in the mask used to select unmasked voxels, defaults to any positive intensity
from 1-99999999 internally expanded to .5 - 99999999.5. If a number is specified voxels with intensities 
within 0.5 of the chosen value are considered selected.}

\item{parallel}{how many processors to run on (default=single processor).
Specified as a two element vector, with the first element corresponding to
the type of parallelization, and the second to the number
of processors to use. For local running set the first element to "local" or "snowfall"
for back-compatibility, anything else will be run with batchtools see \link{pMincApply}
Leaving this argument NULL runs sequentially.}

\item{cleanup}{Whether or not to remove parallelization files}

\item{conf_file}{A batchtools configuration file defaulting to \code{getOption("RMINC_BATCH_CONF")}}
}
\value{
Returns an array with the F-statistic for each model specified by 
formula with the following attributes: 
\itemize{
\item{model}{ design matrix}
\item{filenames}{ minc file names input}
\item{dimensions}{ dimensions of the statistics matrix}
\item{dimnames}{ names of the dimensions for the statistic matrix}
\item{stat-type}{ types of statistic used}
\item{df}{ degrees of freedom of each statistic}
}
