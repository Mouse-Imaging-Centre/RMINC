\usage{
anatGetAll(
  filenames,
  atlas = NULL,
  defs = getOption("RMINC_LABEL_DEFINITIONS"),
  method = c("jacobians", "labels", "sums", "means"),
  side = c("both", "left", "right"),
  parallel = NULL,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{filenames}{A vector of filenames (strings) which contain the
information to be extracted at every structure in the atlas.}

\item{atlas}{One of: NULL if the method is labels, a single atlas file for all subjects,
or a vector of one atlas file per subject.}

\item{defs}{A string pointing to the filename containing the label
definitions. Used to map the integers in the atlas to a
proper name for the structure and contains additional
information for laterality of each structure. See \link{voxel_atlas_defs}
for details.}

\item{method}{A string specifying the way information is to be computed at every voxel (default is "jacobians"). See the details section for the possible options and what they mean.}

\item{side}{One of three choices, "right", "left", or "both" (the default) which specify what labels to obtain.}

\item{parallel}{how many processors to run on (default=single processor).
Specified as a two element vector, with the first element corresponding to
the type of parallelization, and the second to the number
of processors to use. For local running set the first element to "local" or "snowfall"
for back-compatibility, anything else will be run with batchtools see \link{pMincApply}
Leaving this argument NULL runs sequentially.}

\item{strict}{check if any files differ in step sizes}

\item{conf_file}{A batchtools configuration file defaulting to \code{getOption("RMINC_BATCH_CONF")}}
}
\value{
A matrix with ncols equal to the number of labels in the atlas and
nrows equal to the number of files.
}
\description{
Computes volumes, means, sums, and similar values across a
segmented atlas
}
\details{
anatGetAll needs a set of files, an atlas (unless method=="labels"), and a set of
atlas definitions. In the end it will produce one value per label
in the atlas for each of the input files. How that value is
computed depends on the methods argument:
\itemize{
  \item{jacobians -}{ Each file contains log jacobians, and the volume for
  each atlas label is computed by multiplying the jacobian with
  the voxel volume at each voxel.
  }
  \item{labels -}{ Each file contains integer labels (i.e. same as the atlas).
  The volume is computed by counting the number of voxels with
  each label and multiplying by the voxel volume.
  }
  \item{means -}{ Each file contains an arbitrary number and the mean of all
  voxels inside each label is computed.
  }
  \item{sums -}{ Each file contains an aribtrary number and the sum of all
  voxels inside each label is computed.
  }
}
If multiple atlases are passed in each subject will have the summary computed
with respect to their atlas.
