\title{estimate the degrees of freedom for parameters in a mincLmer model}
\usage{
mincLmerEstimateDF(model)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{the output of mincLmer}
}
\value{
the same mincLmer model, now with degrees of freedom set
}
\description{
There is much uncertainty in how to compute p-values for mixed-effects
statistics, related to the correct calculation of the degrees of freedom
of the model (see here \url{http://glmm.wikidot.com/faq#df}). mincLmer by
default does not return the degrees of freedom as part of its model, instead
requiring an explicit call to a separate function (such as this one).
The implementation here is the Satterthwaite approximation. This approximation
is computed from the data, to avoid the significant run-time requirement of computing
it separate for every voxel, here it is only computed on a small number of voxels
within the mask and the median DF returned for every variable.
